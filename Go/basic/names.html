    <p>
      Names are as important in Go as in any other language. They even have semantic effect: the visibility of a name outside a package 
      is determined by whether its first character is upper case. It's therefore worth spending a little time talking about naming conventions in Go programs.

      <p>
        In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter. For example, <strong>Pizza</strong> is an exported name, 
        as is <strong>Pi</strong>, which is exported from the math package. <strong>pizza</strong> and <strong>pi</strong> do 
        not start with a capital letter, so they are not exported.
      </p>
      <p>When importing a package, you can refer only to its exported names. Any "unexported" names are not accessible from outside the package.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <ul>
        <li>DO use mixed case (e.g. maxValue or MaxValue)</li>
        <li>DO use short names (1 or 2 characters) for local variable names (e.g. mv := 5)</li>
        <li>DO use long names for global variables (e.g. var maxValue int = 5)</li>
        <li>DO NOT use underscores</li>

      <p>When a package is imported, the package name becomes an accessor for the contents.</p>
      <p>
        The package name is only the default name for imports; it need not be unique across all source code, and in the 
        rare case of a collision the importing package can choose a different name to use locally.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>DO use short names e.g. "fmt", "errors"</li>
        <li>DO use a single word</li>
        <li>DO use the base name of the source directory. The package in <strong>src/encoding/base64</strong> is imported as <strong>"encoding/base64"</strong></li>
        <li>DO NOT use mix case</li>
        <li>DO NOT use plurals</li>
