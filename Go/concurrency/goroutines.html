    <h1><a href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#goroutines" target="_blank">Goroutines</a></h1>

    <p>
      A goroutine has a simple model: it is a function executing concurrently with other goroutines in the same address
      space. It is lightweight, costing little more than the allocation of stack space. And the stacks start small, so they are
      cheap, and grow by allocating (and freeing) heap storage as required.
    </p>

    <p>
      Goroutines takes about 2kb of space compared to 1-2MB for a thread.
    </p>

    <p>
      Goroutines are multiplexed onto multiple OS threads so if one should block, such as while waiting for I/O, others
      continue to run.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The example below will only print "in bar". We won't see output from the two goroutines because we'll exit
        <code>main()</code>
        before those goroutines complete, but they will complete.

        <pre>
<code>
func main() {
  <span class="comment">// Executed in a separate goroutine which executes concurrently and exits silently.</span>
  go foo()

  <span class="comment">//Same for anonymous functions.</span>
  go func(name string) {
    fmt.Println(name)
  }("John")

  bar()
}

func foo() {
  fmt.Println("in foo")
}

func bar() {
  fmt.Println("in bar")
}
</code>
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        You can add a "wait" at the end of <code>main()</code> so that we end up waiting long enough to see the output.

        <pre>
<code>
func main() {
  <span class="comment">// Executed in a separate goroutine which executes concurrently and exits silently.</span>
  go foo()

  <span class="comment">//Same for anonymous functions.</span>
  go func(name string) {
    fmt.Println(name)
  }("John")

  bar()

  <span class="comment">//Lets wait long enough</span>
  time.Sleep(time.Second)
}

func foo() {
  fmt.Println("in foo")
}

func bar() {
  fmt.Println("in bar")
}
</code>
          </pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
