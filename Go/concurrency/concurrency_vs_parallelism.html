      <p>
        Concurrency is about handling numerous tasks at once. This means that you are working to manage numerous tasks done at once 
        in a given period of time. However, <strong>you will only be doing a single task at a time</strong>. This tends to happen in programs where 
        one task is waiting and the program determines to drive another task in the idle time. It is an aspect of the problem 
        domain — where your program needs to handle numerous simultaneous events.
      </p>
      <p>
        A CPU core can handle one thing at a time. When we talk about concurrency, we are doing one thing at a time but we divide CPU Time 
        among things that need to be processed. Hence we get a sensation of multiple things happening at the same time in in reality, 
        only one thing is happening at a time.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Parallelism (doing multiple things at once)</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Parallelism is about doing lots of tasks at once. This means that even if we have two tasks, they are continuously 
        working without any breaks in between them. It is an aspect of the solution domain — where you want to make your 
        program faster by processing different portions of the problem in parallel.
      </p>
      <p>
        When our CPU have multiple cores, we can use different CPU cores to do multiple things at once. This means it can do multiple
        things AT THE SAME TIME.
