    <h1>Wait Groups</h1>
    <p>
      A WaitGroup is used to wait for a collection of Goroutines to finish executing. The control is blocked until all Goroutines 
      finish executing. Lets say we have 3 concurrently executing Goroutines spawned from the main Goroutine. The main Goroutines 
      needs to wait for the 3 other Goroutines to finish before terminating. This can be accomplished using WaitGroup.
    </p>

    <pre>
<code>
package main

import (  
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "time"
)

func process(i int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {  
    fmt.Println("started Goroutine ", i)
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
    fmt.Printf("Goroutine %d ended\n", i)

    wg.Done() <span class="comment">//decrement the counter because goroutine is done</span>
}

func main() {  
    counter := 3 <span class="comment">//num. of goroutines we expect</span>
    var wg sync.WaitGroup

    for i := 0; i < counter; i++ {
        wg.Add(1) <span class="comment">//increment our counter for each goroutine we start</span>
        go process(i, &wg)
    }

    wg.Wait() <span class="comment">//Will wait here until counter is back to 0</span>
    fmt.Println("All go routines finished executing")
}
