    <p>
      The select statement lets a goroutine wait on multiple communication operations.
      A select blocks until one of its cases can run, then it executes that case. It chooses one at random if multiple
      are ready.

        Timeouts are important for programs that connect to external resources or that otherwise need to bound execution
        time.
        Implementing timeouts in Go is easy and elegant thanks to channels and select. Basically in a select you add a
        case
        that will trigger after a certain period of time. So if no other cases have triggered before then we still have
        a wait
        to exit our select.
      </p>

          In this example we print out "timeout 1" because our goroutine writes to the channel after 2 seconds, but in
          our select
          we have a timeout after 1 second.
          <pre>
<code>
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "time"
)

func main() {

  c1 := make(chan string, 1)
  go func() {
      <span class="comment">//Write "result 2" to channel after 2 seconds</span>
      time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
      c1 <- "result 1"
  }()

  select {
  case res := <-c1:
      fmt.Println(res)
  case <-time.After(1 * time.Second): <span class="comment">//Timeout after 1 second of waiting</span>
      fmt.Println("timeout 1")
  }
}
</code>          
        </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          In this example we print out "result 2" because our goroutine writes to the channel after 2 seconds, but in
          our select
          we have a timeout after 3 second which gives enough time for us to read from our channel.

package main

func main() {
  c2 := make(chan string, 1)
  go func() {
      <span class="comment">//Write "result 2" to channel after 2 seconds</span>
      time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
