    <h1><a href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#channels" target="_blank">Channels</a></h1>
    <p>
      Channels are the pipes that connect concurrent goroutines. You can send values into channels from one goroutine
      and
      receive those values into another goroutine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>NOTE:</strong> Channels are perfect for splitting work across multiple goroutines.
    </p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Unbuffered Channel</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Unbuffered channel is the default. A channel can only hold a single value which means we can only write one
        value to it
        and have to wait until someone reads from the channel before we're allowed to write another value to it.
        Attempts to write
        another value to the channel while it's full will result in the write being blocked. Sends and receives block
        until both the
        sender and receiver are ready.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can create a channel to send a value to one goroutine and read it in another. In the example below
          we create a channel that supports a string value. We kick off a goroutine that sends "ping" through the
          channel
          and in our main process we read the value from the channel.

          <pre>
<code>
func main() {

  <span class="comment">//new channel that accepts a string</span>
  message := make(chan string)

  <span class="comment">//kick off a separate goroutine</span>
  go func() {
    <span class="comment">//pass a string to the channel</span>
    message <- "ping"
  }()
  
  go func() {
    <span class="comment">//pass a string to the channel</span>
    message <- "pong"
  }()

  <span class="comment">//read the value from the channel</span>
  <span class="comment">//it'll wait here until it receives a value</span>
  s := <-message
  fmt.Println(s) <span class="comment">//Prints "pong" because values in a channel are LIFO</span>
  
  x := <-message
  fmt.Println(x) <span class="comment">//Prints "ping" because values in a channel are LIFO</span>
} 
</code>
        </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            By default you can only write to a channel if there is something ready to read from it. In the below example
            we print out:
          </p>
          <span class="comment">
            goroutine start</br>
            goroutine end</br>
            found: 5</br>
            done
          </span>
          <p>
            However, if we comment out <code>s := <-message</code> then we have no receiving of the channel value. This
            mean
            the write to the channel remains in a wait until a receiver is created. For that example we only print out
            the following
            because the goroutine gets stuck in <code>message <- 5</code>
          </p>
          <span class="comment">
            goroutine start</br>
            done
          </span>

          <pre>
<code>
func main() {

  message := make(chan int)

  go func() {
    fmt.Println("goroutine start")
    message <- 5
    fmt.Println("goroutine end")
  }()

  s := <-message
  fmt.Println("found: ", s)
  time.Sleep(time.Second * 3)
  fmt.Println("done")
}  
</code>
        </pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Buffered Channel</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Buffered channels accept a limited number of values without a corresponding receiver for those values.
      </p>

      <p>
        The example below will allow us to write up to 2 values into the channel before the channel is considered
        full. In order to write another value into it we must read one from it. This means your buffer length is the
        most
        values that can be sitting in the channel at once.
      </p>
      <pre>
<code>
ch := make(chan int, 2)
ch <- 1
ch <- 2
fmt.Println(<-ch)
fmt.Println(<-ch)
</code>
        </pre>

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        You can <a href="https://godoc.org/builtin#close" target="_blank">close</a> a channel (should be done by the
        sender, not receiver) to indicate there will be no more values coming through.
        You don't usually need to <a href="https://godoc.org/builtin#close" target="_blank">close</a> a channel so you
        would only do it when you need the receiver to know that the channel is done sending, for example when using ranges.
      </p>

      <pre>
<code>
func process(max int, c chan int) {
  <span class="comment">// Go through each value and send it to the channel</span>
  for x := 0; x < max; x++ {
    c <- x
  }

  <span class="comment">// Lets the receiver know there is nothing else to send</span>
  close(c)
}

func main() {
  c := make(chan int, 10)

  <span class="comment">// Kick off goroutine to iterate through all values</span>
  go process(cap(c), c)

  <span class="comment">// Keep receiving values until the channel is closed</span>
  for i := range c {
    fmt.Println(i)
  }
