    <h1><a href="https://golangbot.com/buffered-channels-worker-pools/" target="_blank">Worker Pool</a></h1>
    <p>
      In general, a worker pool is a collection of threads which are waiting for tasks to be assigned to them.
      Once they finish the task assigned, they make themselves available again for the next task.
      <strong>NOTE: This is similar to Resque Workers in Ruby on Rails</strong>
    </p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        The below is a simple example of multipler "workers" processing jobs. Each worker will keep checking
        the "jobs" channel to see if there is a job to process. It'll keep doing this until there are no more jobs left
        to process.

package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "time"
)

func worker(id int, jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int) {
  <span class="comment">// Iterates through jobs in the channel</span>
  for j := range jobs {
    fmt.Println("worker", id, "started  job", j)
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
    fmt.Println("worker", id, "finished job", j)
    results <- j * 2
  }
}

func main() {
  const numJobs = 100
  jobs := make(chan int, numJobs)
  results := make(chan int, numJobs)

        The below example uses Wait groups to keep track of our workers. It'll ensure that we only complete the program
        when all of our Wait groups are done waiting.
