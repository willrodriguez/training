      <p>
        Your Go code is kept in a workspace. The Go tool understands the layout of a workspace. 
        The <a href="environment.html">$GOPATH</a> environment variable tells GO where your workspace is located at.
      </p>
      <p style="color:red">
				In 1.11 version, Go introduces the build-in package management called Go <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules" target="_blank">Modules</a>
				which is beginning for major change Go ecosystem. It is an alternative to GOPATH with integrated support for versioning and package distribution.

        Below is how our workspace is populated if we retrieved the <strong>fixhub</strong> package with <code>go get github.com/dsymonds/fixhub</code>.
        Now if later on we added another package and it also needed <strong>github.com/golang/lint</strong> package then it would just use 
        the one we already have in our workspace.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you create your own project then it would go under <strong>$GOPATH/src/github.com/[your_user]/[your_project]</strong>.
      </p>

<code>
$GOPATH/
  bin/                        # installed binary
    fixhub/
      ...

      <p>
        This is just a recommended project layout pattern based on historical and emerging projects in the Go ecosystem. You won't need every
        subdirectory in every project because it heavily depends on the purpose of the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Go 1.14 Go Modules are finally ready for production. You no longer need to place your project under <strong>$GOPATH/src</strong>
        Wherever you decide to put your project code it should still follow a standard naming convention like <strong>[myroot]/github.com/[your_user]/[your_project]</strong>.
        It's a good habit to organize your code as if you will publish it someday.
      </p>
